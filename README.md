# PewPew
Simple, arcade game where you move spaceship using WSAD and shoot enemies using mouse pointer. There are several enemies types, and stages. The player can collect money and buy new ships or upgrade the owned. Like with TD, the game was ported to MonoGame, but with stripped functionality - because newer engine removed a few used APIs.
